 Database Interaction
1️.Storing and Tracking Requests
Create Request:
When a new CSV file is uploaded, a new request document is created with:
A unique request ID
Status set to "PENDING"
Update Request Status:
As the worker processes the images, the request status is updated to:
"PROCESSING"
"COMPLETED"
"FAILED"

2️. Storing Product Data
Create Product:
For each row in the CSV file, a new product document is created with:
The associated requestId
serialNumber
productName
inputImageUrls
Update Product Data:
Once the images are processed, the product document is updated with:
outputImageUrls
